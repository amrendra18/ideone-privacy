Ideone Privacy
==============

This script takes care of the privacy settings at Ideone.com

What this script does exactly?
1. Sets privacy for Ideone submissions to private by default when page loads(user needs to be signed-in for this).
2. Alerts and confirms when user tries to make a public/secret paste.


Where can this be useful?
Ideone is the best online compiler to test one's code, many programmers use this platform to test their code.
Many times user accidentally makes their code publically available on Ideone, which they dont intend to,
specially solutions for a ongoing competitive programming contest.
